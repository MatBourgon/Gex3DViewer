# What is this?
This project is the beginning of a level viewer, and eventually, level editor for Gex 2: Enter the Gecko.
The engine is currently set up to work with the PC build and its files.

# How to use
Open up the level viewer, and pick a level file (.dfx). Make sure its matching graphics file (.vfx) is in the same directory, as the program will automatically load it up at the same time.
